Easy to Oracle - Free open source data integration==================================================Oracle To Oracle, why ?-----------------------Datareplication from an Oracle source database to an Oracle target database!Why I hear you ask. Isn't a database link or datapump easier and faster ?This is absolutely true. Database links are easier to install (part of the database) and easier to use. And is in fact about two times faster thaneasy-2-oracle. So why add this option?Well, this part of easy-2-oracle wasn't meant for Oracle target databases, butfor versions ported to other target databases/platforms, like R.EasyNTOra---------Name of the executable should be EasyOTOra, but this name is already in usefor 'Office' databases. I used the nearest letter in the alphabet instead.
